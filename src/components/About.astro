          Tobias Lorsbach is a Mainz, Germany-based artist known as <span
            class="artist-name">Logic Moon</span
          >. His previous releases have appeared on internationally recognized
          labels such as Whitelabrecs, Archives, Archipel, DRONARIVM,
          Ambientologist, Shimmering Moods, and his own Logic Moon Music imprint
          across both physical and digital formats. He spent many years in the
          minimal techno scenes since the early 2000s, and whilst out on a field
          recording excursion, he fell upon the idea of layering some ambient
          drones. From here, his debut album as <span class="artist-name"
            >Logic Moon</span
          > was born - "Herbst11".
        </p>

          Tobias' musical background has drawn in a widescreen of genres, with
          him having performed guitar in a death metal band, embarked on a DJ
          career, and now established himself as an ambient musician. His varied
          experiences have only served to give birth to a range of ideas which
          are evident in his acclaimed albums, including "I See Planets" (2019)
          and his most recent release "Music For Film Vol.1" (2024), alongside
          numerous collaborative works.
