      <h1>Artist Profile: Logic Moon (Tobias Lorsbach)</h1>

      <h2>Biographical Information</h2>

      <p>
        Tobias <em>"Logic Moon"</em> Lorsbach comes from Mainz, Germany. He began
        his musical career as a DJ and was active in the minimal techno scene in
        the early 2000s. At the same time, he played guitar in a death metal band
        until he increasingly turned to ambient music. During a <strong
          >field recording trip</strong
        >, the idea arose to combine ambient drone elements with his recordings
        – this resulted in his debut album <em>Herbst11</em> as Logic Moon in 2013.
        His compositions often begin with a guitar sketch, followed by synthesizers
        and other layers. This <strong>cross-genre background</strong> (techno, metal,
        ambient) shapes his stylistic approach: The press describes that Tobias as
        Logic Moon makes "guitar-oriented ambient and drone music" and his music
        is often perceived as "lively" and as a balance between classical accessibility
        and experimental discovery.

        titles appeared on renowned ambient labels, including the Dutch Ambientologist

        vinyl editions.
      </p>

      <h2>Musical Style</h2>

      <p>
        Logic Moon's music merges <strong
          >ambient, drone and neoclassical</strong
        > influences. Typical are <strong
          >sound-painterly, cinematic soundscapes</strong
        > with electronic and acoustic elements. His pieces often begin with guitar
        or piano motifs, overlaid with flowing synthesizer drones, strings and field
        recordings. An example of this is the album <em
          >The Unavoidable Death of Loneliness</em
        >: It weaves "melodic piano and guitar lines" with dark string sounds
        and hammering rhythms, supported by old tube amplifiers and tape noise
        for warmth and humanity. Neoclassical components also appear – for
        example, the collaboration album <em>The Quiet Companion</em> (2023) is characterized
        by <strong
          >"gentle neoclassical pieces with piano, synthesizer pads and strings"</strong
        >. His <em>Lux</em> EP (2023), for example, is described as an "atmospheric
        sound tapestry" that combines contemporary ambient electronics with subtle
        neoclassical touches. Critics consistently praise the <strong
          >dense atmosphere</strong
        > and the mixture of organic and synthetic sounds – from bright guitar picking
        to texturally rich drone surfaces to quiet bird and nature recordings.
      </p>

      <h2>Special Works</h2>

      <p>
        Several works by Logic Moon found particular attention in the ambient
        community:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>"The Unavoidable Death of Loneliness" (2022)</strong> – a collaboration
          with Sven Laux. This album addresses the loneliness of the Corona pandemic.
          In reviews it is described as a seamless mix of post-classical and electronic
          ambient elements. Ambientblog writes that Laux and Lorsbach "merge post-classical
          arrangements and ambient soundscapes into adventurous, cinematic compositions."
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>"The Quiet Companion" (2023)</strong> – another joint long player
          with Sven Laux on Shimmering Moods Records. It consists of nine minimalist,
          neoclassically influenced instrumental pieces (with occasional vocals by
          Julia Gjertsen) and was praised by reviewers for its gentle harmony between
          piano, string and synthesizer sounds.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>"Ewiger Wald" (2024)</strong> and <strong
            >"Ewiger Wald Addendum" (2024)</strong
          > – two experimental mini albums with Swedish cellist Henrik Meierkord.
          In this project, Logic Moon and Meierkord explore a <em
            >"modern neoclassical ambient"</em
          > aesthetic by interweaving his emotional cello passages with Logic Moon's
          characteristic drones and synths. This double album (originally <em
            >Ewiger Wald</em
          > on Dronarivm, and the <em>Addendum</em> version with remixes) shows the
          fusion of electroacoustic elements with classical instrumentation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Other noteworthy releases include <em>I See Planets</em> (2020, WhiteLabelRec),
        <em>Philia – Fountain</em> (2022) or <em>Sun</em> (2023), which resonated
        with fans and on various ambient playlists. Logic Moon also maintains an
        active YouTube channel with his music videos (mostly with sci-fi images)
        and curates ambient playlists, which additionally showcases his projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Collaborations</h2>

      <p>
        Logic Moon frequently works with other artists and labels. Significant
        collaborations include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sven Laux</strong> – Several albums were released together: <em
            >The Unavoidable Death of Loneliness</em
          > (2022, Ambientologist) and <em>The Quiet Companion</em> (2023, Shimmering
          Moods). Both albums show the close musical partnership of the two composers.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Henrik Meierkord</strong> – The Swedish cellist appeared on the
          mini albums <em>Ewiger Wald</em> and <em>Ewiger Wald Addendum</em> (2024).
          Logic Moon mixes his electronic drones with Meierkord's cello into neoclassical
          ambient studies here.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Julia Gjertsen</strong> – The singer is a guest on <em
            >The Quiet Companion</em
          > (track "Together But Apart"), which gives the album an additional emotional
          note.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Scarless Arms (Tyve Oben)</strong> – With this producer, Logic
          Moon shared the <em>Moon Scars</em> EP in 2023, a six-track collaboration
          in cinematic ambient style.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Labels</strong> – In addition to the already mentioned labels Ambientologist
          and Shimmering Moods, he released on Archipel (D DR), Archives (GB), DE_ST_REC,
          Dronarivm (D), Whitelabrecs (JP) and his own label Logic Moon Records or
          spontanMusik. This collaboration with renowned ambient labels has given
          him international visibility in the scene.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reviews and Criticism</h2>

      <p>
        Logic Moon received positive response in the trade press and ambient
        blogs. For example, Ambientblog praises the cinematic character of his
        work, such as the album <em>The Unavoidable Death of Loneliness</em>,
        which "combines post-classical arrangements and ambient soundscapes into
        adventurous, cinematic compositions." International websites also
        highlight how well Logic Moon's style complements his partners.
        Headphone Commute describes <em>The Quiet Companion</em> as a collection
        of "gentle, neoclassical pieces with piano, synthesizer pads and strings"
        that harmoniously grow together despite spatial distance. In interviews and
        features, it is often emphasized that Tobias Lorsbach's experience from techno
        and metal as well as his use of guitars and field recordings give his ambient
        music an organic depth. Listeners appreciate the emotional access and the
        multi-layered atmosphere of his albums, as fan reviews and blog features
        repeatedly confirm. Overall, Logic Moon is considered a seasoned producer
        with consistently high quality: His releases are usually perceived as <strong
          >"expressive"</strong
        > and <strong>"finely balanced"</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Influence and Significance</h2>

      <p>
        Logic Moon is among the active players in the contemporary ambient and
        experimental scene. Through numerous releases on international labels
        and his collaborations, he contributes to the network of European
        ambient artists. With over 40 releases since 2012, he has established a
        firm place in the scene. His style – the combination of electronic
        ambient music with neoclassical and acoustic elements – inspires other
        artists to explore similar cross-genre soundscapes. He also engages as a
        curator (e.g. of ambient playlists on streaming services) and thus
        shapes the listening habits of the community. In sum, Logic Moon is

          >important representative of the German ambient movement</strong
