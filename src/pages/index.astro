              Tobias Lorsbach is a Mainz, Germany-based artist known as <span
                class="artist-name">Logic Moon</span
              >. His previous releases have appeared on internationally
              recognized labels such as Whitelabrecs, Archives, Archipel,
              DRONARIVM, Ambientologist, Shimmering Moods, and his own Logic
              Moon Music imprint across both physical and digital formats. He
              spent many years in the minimal techno scenes since the early
              2000s, and whilst out on a field recording excursion, he fell upon
              the idea of layering some ambient drones. From here, his debut
              album as <span class="artist-name">Logic Moon</span> was born - "Herbst11".
            </p>

            <p>
              Tobias' musical background has drawn in a widescreen of genres,
              with him having performed guitar in a death metal band, embarked
              on a DJ career, and now established himself as an ambient
              musician. His varied experiences have only served to give birth to
              a range of ideas which are evident in his acclaimed albums,
              including "I See Planets" (2019) and his most recent release
              "Music For Film Vol.1" (2024), alongside numerous collaborative
              works.

              drone compositions, often incorporating field recordings and
              creating atmospheric journeys that transport listeners to
              otherworldly realms.
