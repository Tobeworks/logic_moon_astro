I'm thrilled to announce my new album, "Ashes," will be released on Chitra Records on July 18, 2025. 
This album is a meditative journey through dark tales, with ambient reflections on memory and what lingers beyond. While it ventures into Dark Ambient territories, it also retains my signature warm sound.

"Ashes" is a 10-track album with a total runtime of 38 minutes. It will be available on 12" Vinyl and CD. You can pre-order it now from [elasticStage](https://elasticstage.com/chitrarecords/releases/ashes-album).

**Side A**
1. Transient Light (3:12)
2. The Venus (3:50)
3. The Dust (2:45)
4. The Wintr (4:24)

1. Ashes (3:59)
2. The Ground (3:51)
