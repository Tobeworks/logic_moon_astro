I'm excited to share a new chapter in my creative journey: the launch of **Aethery Fields**, a distinct subproject under the Logic Moon umbrella.

As an ambient artist, I've always been fascinated by the subtle variations in mood and atmosphere that different tracks can evoke. While Logic Moon represents my core sound and identity which has evolved significantly toward dark ambient and sci-fi soundscapes over the past 24 months I found myself creating pieces that demanded their own space, tracks with different impressions, textures, and emotional landscapes that deserved to be categorized and experienced separately.

**Aethery Fields** was born from this need to better organize and present these varied musical expressions. This subproject allows me to explore atmospheric territories that might feel distinct from my main Logic Moon releases, while still maintaining the ethereal and introspective qualities that define my work.

Under the Aethery Fields banner, you can expect:

- **Experimental ambient textures** that push beyond traditional boundaries
- **Field recording integrations** that create immersive environmental experiences  
- **Varied emotional palettes** featuring lighter, easy-listening atmospheres, ranging from luminous and tape-influenced to Asian-inspired and contemplative
- **Minimalistic lo-fi approach** with heavy use of toysound, acoustics and modular synthesis in composition and sound design

This isn't about fragmenting my artistic identity, but rather about giving each piece the most appropriate context for listeners to discover and connect with the music. Some tracks naturally gravitate toward the warm, more melodic and lighter space that Logic Moon is known for, while others call for the more experimental and atmospheric realm that Aethery Fields will represent.

The first Aethery Fields album was finished last year and I'm about to release it soon. I'm thrilled about the creative possibilities this new framework opens up. It allows me to be more intentional about how different moods and impressions are presented, giving each track the sonic home it deserves.
